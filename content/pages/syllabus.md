## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 90 minutes / session

## Prerequisites

This is an introductory graduate course, although advanced undergraduates are also welcome to attempt it. Close familiarity with undergraduate algebra (groups, rings, modules etc.) will be assumed. 

## Course Description & Topics

The beginning of the course will cover fundamental concepts forming the basic vocabulary of the algebraic language in today’s math. 

- Concepts:
    - Rings, modules
    - (Semi)simple rings, division rings
    - Wedderburn Theorem, Jordan-Hoelder and Krull-Schmidt Theorem
    - Prime radical, Jacobson radical
    - Artinian rings
- Categories:
    - Yoneda Lemma, adjoint functors
    - Additive and abelian categories
    - Morita theory
- Basic homological algebra: 
    - δ-functors
    - Tor’s, Ext’s
    - group (co)homology
    - global dimension, etc.
- These will be followed by somewhat more specialized topics:
    - Koszul algebras
    - Ore Localization and Goldie Theorem
    - Central simple algebras and Brauer group
    - PI algebras
    - Growth of algebras
    - Some ideas of Noncommutative geometry

## Assignments and Grading

Biweekly homework assignments will be given.  Grades will be based on the homework.  Students are also invited to prepare an {{% resource_link "35442035-9f5f-4870-a21f-523cf1d2cd4b" "optional expository paper" %}} for extra credit.  There are no exams.
